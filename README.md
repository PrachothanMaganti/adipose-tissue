# adipose-tissue
Using machine learning techniques to estimate adipose tissue from waist circumference involves training a model on a dataset
 containing waist circumference measurements and corresponding adipose tissue volumes or masses. The process includes data
 collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring. Features
 such as age, gender, height, and weight may be considered to improve model performance
